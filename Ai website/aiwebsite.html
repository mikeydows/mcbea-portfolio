                    <h3>Introduction To Ai</h3>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation 
                        of human intelligence in machines that are 
                        programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. 
                        AI systems can perform tasks such as speech recognition,
                        decision-making, visual perception, and language 
                        translation. From virtual assistants to self-driving 
                        cars, AI is transforming 
                        industries and reshaping the way we live and work.

                    <h2>Overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI):</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development
                        of computer systems capable of performing tasks 
                        that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems use 
                        algorithms and large datasets to recognize patterns, 
                        make decisions, and adapt to new information.
